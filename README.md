BDSM-qt and Fetish-qt updates 22nd November 2014

Versions 6.9.6.9: Required wallet change

============
Fetish Specs

690,000 coins (690 thousand)

630,000 blocks

1 minute average per block

Retarget every 2 blocks

============

Rewards

0.00000 – 200,000 = 2.3 (460,000)

200,001 – 300,000 = 1.15 (575,000)

300,001 – 400,000 = 0.5 (625,000)

400,001 – 500,000 = 0.3 (655,000)

500,001 – 510,000 = 2.3 (678,000)

510,001 – 630,000 = 0.1 (690,000)

============

The last 65,000 of the 690,000 FETISH play be the new rules. This might not seem much, but the staggered coin count deceases from 1.15 (original minimum reward) to 0.5, 0.3 and 0.1. To counter that, there is the chance to mine at the original reward for 10,000 blocks starting at block 500,001. The real delay is after that point. There will be just 12,000 FETISH left and these will be mined over 120,000 blocks.

The same applies for BDSM, except everything is multiplied by 10 to match the 6.9 million coin cap.

400,001 – 500,000 = 3 (6,550,000)

500,001 – 510,000 = 23 (6,780,000)

510,001 – 630,000 = 1 (6,900,000)

Changes made to previous version

The last 650,000 of the 6.9 million BDSM play be the new rules. This might not seem much, but the staggered coin count deceases from 11.5 (original minimum reward) to 5, 3 and 1. To counter that, there is the chance to mine at the original reward for 10,000 blocks starting at block 500,000. The real delay is after that point. There will be just 120,000 BDSM left and these will be mined over 120,000 blocks.
